        <h1>Intro</h1>
        <p>In Ultra Cogent realism and ease of use is key. That being said, the system si potentially more complicated then Cogent Roleplay, but the complexity should be hidden behind interactive web based tools which should work in any modern browser on any modern operating system, relying on the fact that nowadays most people have phones, tablets, and/or laptops available.
        <br>Needless to say, I highly advise players and GMs to bring chargers and/or power banks with your devices to roleplay sessions. (If it wasn't obvious enough that you may need them...)
        <br>That being said the rulebook should contain all the formulas required to play using pen and paper for those who want to know how it works, or want to try playing at insane level of difficulty.
        <br>Enjoy! :)

        <h1>Character Creation</h1>
        <h2>Formulas</h2>
        <p> As usual character chreation starts with Character name (required for exporting), Sex (Male, Female or n/a for machines or other non biological entities is required), Race (optional), Age (The exact age is relative to race and thus optional, however selecting an age interval such as Child, Youth, Adult, Elderly for biological entities or Ageless for machines is required.) and Physique (similar to body type in cogent, but you can only select from a limited list of Fragile, Weak, Average, Strong or Monstrous, and it's also required.).
        <br>Long text fields such as Beliefs and Morality, Disposition, etc. as well as the image URL are optional again.
        <br>Optional fields are only informative, however certain specs depend on required fields, so choose carefuly.</p>
        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>In Ultra Cogent there are 5 attributes, Strength, Reflex, Intelligence as in the current Cogent Roleplay (v1.3 alpha) and 2 different: Physical Integrity, and Mental Integrity.
        <br>Strength, Reflex and Intelligence have almost the same benefits as in Cogent Roleplay v1.3 alpha, however the player doesn't necessarily supposed to spend points on them at character creation.
        <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Formulas</h2>
        <p>Physical Integrity = 6D6 + Physique (-2D6 to +2D6) + Male Bonus (+1D6) + Total Strength (-1D6 to +5D6) + Physical Immunity Problems (-2D6 to 0D6) + Age Interval (-2D6 to 0D6)
        <br>Mental Integrity = 4D6 + Female Bonus (+1D6) + Total Intelligence (-1D6 to +5D6) + Brain Damage or Mental Disorder (-2D6 to 0D6)
