- Here comes the page content and only the page content. The idea is that each time you add a page to your site, you only have to make the page content, and fill a header form with the appropriate data. The rest is done by the Construct.sh script. The construct script will take care of Dark and Light variants for you, so you only need 1 instance of the page content here.
- Use the PAGE template I provided, otherwise Construct.sh may have trouble assembling pages...
- Use the deep template in the Projects, and Archived folders... (it's essentially the same except most paths needs a "../" in front...)
- If you create a page, and you want it to be linked in automatically to the Projects.html page, you need to add a D-filename file(with no extension) in the Description folder, containing a short description of the project. This allows you to make a page, and publish it later... Filename should match the content pages's filename.

- A-filename.html pages are a placeholder for archived pages added and handled automatically by the Archiver.sh script... Deleting them may cause 404 errors for everyone who used the link on his/her site. Those are not re-generated by the construct script with -n option, and linked in to archived projects on the Projects page(as their description file has been moved to Archived/Descriptions directory). Use the archiver.sh script to archive a page, and also avoid making 404 errors on other sites...

- Note that if the head content file is missing, the construct script will keep trying to read a non existent file indefinitely, thus never fininsh generating the page... that's an issue I'll try to solve later, since it works fine using the templates... If that happens use Ctrl+C to stop the script, and add a head content file, then try again.
- Head content file should have the same name, as this one, but other content, and it should be in the HeadContent directory...
