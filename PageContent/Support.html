<h2>Should you consider donating and how much?!</h2>
<div class="TranslucentPanel"><div class="PanelArea">
<p>I may loose donations by setting this standard, but I want you to think! So here's how I consider donating:
<br>- Do you have any loans? If so then important things first... Get rid of those ASAP!
<br>- Can you afford to give? If you make barely enough then don't! There's no shame in that.
<br>- Can you donate without regret and/or expectations?! If you can't you shouldn't donate to anyone...
<br>
<br>- Do you find Ultra Cogent useful?!
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Do you use anything I provided?
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Do you enjoy playing or did you learn someting???
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; If so then push the donate button and keep it alive and free for everyone!
<br>- Do you want to support Ultra Cogent?! Donation is NOT payment that I demand, it's something you should give voluntarily!
<br>- How much should you donate? The more the better but no more then you can or would regret giving away! ;)</p>
