- Attribution is required if you adapt, develop or include the Cogent Roleplay System (in part or in whole), by including one of the official Attribution Logos provided HERE: https://bit.ly/CogentAttribution
- This must be included on the cover (back or front) of any published works and in the credits, and must be clear and legible.
- You cannot say "published by" Cogent Roleplay, or imply your project is an official Cogent Roleplay product, nor can you use the Cogent Roleplay logo in any form other than in the context of attribution outlined in this License.
- Any game mechanic or game system you develop based on Cogent Roleplay will be open and freely available for anyone to re-use, include, adapt or develop, in their own projects that are also based on Cogent Roleplay. This is to ensure the continuing open nature, accessibility, and freedom of this system. Just as we are giving you this free license to use Cogent Roleplay, we require you to give the same open license for any game mechanic you develop based on Cogent Roleplay, including commercial ventures. Any intellectual property (characters, brands, stories, designs, etc) will be entirely owned by their original creators and not subject to the same licence.
- Use of the Cogent Roleplay System (in part or in whole) in any project constitutes acceptance of this license.
