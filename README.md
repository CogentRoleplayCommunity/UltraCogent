## Author's message

- As a fan of Shad's and Jazza's simple and realistic approach to roleplaying, I'm a bit concerned by the realistic aspect getting lost since they handed it over to the community. Quite frankly: While I have no problem sharing stuff, I don't trust public voting to make the right decisions. Cogent is not mine to manage, I have 1 vote of many, and even if the comminity would accept all of my suggestions, the adoption process is far too slow for me, so I started Ultra Cogent (my homebrew) with even more realism in mind. :)
- Ultra Cogent has substantial changes, mostly my own ideas, but also some adopted ideas.
