<h2>Author's message</h2>
<p>- As a fan of Shad's and Jazza's simple and realistic approach to roleplaying, I'm a bit concerned by the realistic aspect getting lost since they handed it over to the community. Quite frankly: While I have no problem sharing stuff, I don't trust public voting to make the right decisions. Cogent is not mine to manage, I have 1 vote of many, and even if the comminity would accept all of my suggestions, the adoption process is far too slow for me, so I started Ultra Cogent (my homebrew) with even more realism in mind. :)
<br>- Ultra Cogent has substantial changes, mostly my own ideas, but also some adopted ideas.
</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>- You may use it, share it, fork it and/or make suggestions, but keep in mind that Ultra Cogent is mine and thus I may or may not accept your input.
<br>
<br>- I will ignore any request to include woke ideologies!
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - I've seen games granting me highly destructive weapons, only to educate me about gun control. - Screw that!
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; - I've seen games full of feminism, inclisivity, gender ideologies etc. - I hear that a lot, I ignore that a lot, it annoys me every time and breaks the immersion, so it's time for me to push back against it!
<br> None of those sound fun to me, so if that's what you want to suggest, I suggest you bugger off and make your own fork! :P
</p>

<h2>Navigation tips</h2>
<p>- Hover the mouse to the left, or tap the arrow at the top left corner to reveal the menu.
