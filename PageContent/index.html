<h2>Disclaimer:</h2>
<p>The method used in here was designed from the beginning to handle hundreds, possibly thousands of pages easily by running a few commands in linux shell, requiring only a basic text editor capable of detecting changed content(gedit is fine), but no additional software what so ever. This is for sites that are constantly expanding, like OSRC, blogs, news page, shops, etc, where changes must be applied to possibly thousands of pages at once... This process may not be appropriate, if you're looking for a few page online presence.
<br>Even with that in mind, the scripts may or may not require changes to suit your specific needs. I can not guarantee that this is gonna make your life easier.
<br>I also will not add features on request! I only add features that I need, the rest is up to you. Open source does not mean that I'm gonna make your wish a reality, it means that it's available for you to use/modify/re-distribuite it according to the license.</p>
