<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The pages are assembled from several segment templates, a menu list(that are the same for each file), a header file, and a content file(that are different for each page). In addition to that a few lines and all links are handled by the scripts.
All pages should be managed by the Edit.sh and Archiver.sh scripts.
<br>There are basically 3 types of pages...
<br>Regular pages: Regenerated each time.
<br>Article pages: Automatically added to Articles.html page when it's generated, and can be halted. (halting means not generated if -n option is pecified for the construct scipt.)
<br>Project pages: Automatically added to Projects.html page when it's generated, and can be halted/Archived. (archiving means finished project listed among archived projects meanwhile halted sin't, and not generated if -n option is pecified for the construct scipt.)
<br>
<br>The Construct.sh is used to generate the site.
<br>
<br>The SubmenuGenerator.sh generates the Articles.html, and Projects.html files, but it is called by the Construct.sh automatically, you don't really need to fiddle with it...
<br>
<br>You won't see the LatestUpdates page in the browser unless you delete the Cache.tar.gz package, which contains md5 checksums for tracking changes, and the Construct scripts without -d option, and answer yes when it asks if you want to upload it or not. The LatestUpdates page is only generated before upload, otherwise the cache gets out of sink, and the Construct.sh script may not clean up properly, and/or may think that some files ware not changed leading to not updating properly... (It is not recommended to delete the cache unless you're working on the latest update page... It is also not recommended to answer yes when to the upload question if you're not actually uploading the data...)
<br> The easiest way to fix cache issue, is to delete the cache, re-generate everything, delete eveything from the server, and re-upload everything, which may mean some down time... The other way is to delete the cache, re-generate everything, upload everything overwriting whatever already is on the server, then try to find, and delete files that are not used anymore, and finally check each page for 404s... (That is not fun... :P)
<br>
<br>I realized the whole thing is a mess(Archiving is planned but not well, article pages and halting are both after thought), it could be done better but it works for the time being, and fixing it would mean re-writing most of it, so I may as well do a much cleaner v2.0 instead of fixing it in a sub-version. (Don't wait for it though! May take a while...)</p>
<h2>Changing Page title, style, layout and logo.</h2>
<p>The title of the page, and slogan are located in the PageTop file.
<br>The Logo is a .svg image(vector graphics) in the Images/Common directory. You can create such image in Inkskape. Alternatively I'd advise using high resolution .png image, but you also need to change the extension of the file in the PageStyle.css files (in both dark and light styles.)... Dark and light styles should define the same things, but with different color sets.
<br>The order of assembly is like so: Beginning, HeadContent/filename, HeadOver, PageContent/filename, PageTop, then the menu generated by Construct.sh, End.
<br>If you want to change the layout of the pages not only the style, start by writing a template page... Then disassembling it into all those files, then editing the assembly process, and the menu generation at the build function of the Construct.sh script... (It will requires some understanding of bash scripting...)</p>
